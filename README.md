# LoR-CardMaker

The LoR-CardMaker allows you make custom cards for Riot Games' Legends of Runeterra.  
You can set your own images, stats, keywords, and special abilities.  
Instead of just the 6 regions that are currently in the game, you can select any region in Runeterra including Runeterra itself.  
Use it to create a card for your Champion or make something entirely new.  
Showcase buffs or nerfs you would like to see happen or just make some funny stuff.  
Download your favorite ones and share them on Reddit or wherever you like.
Try it out at: [https://lorcardmaker.com](https://lorcardmaker.com)
